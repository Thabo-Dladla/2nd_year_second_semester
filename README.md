# 2nd Year - Second Semester UCT (Computer Science)

This repository contains my second semester Computer Science work at UCT.  
The main focus here is on **Parallel Computing**.

> *This project was developed from a serial base program provided by my lecturer, Michelle, as course material.  
> My contributions focused on extending it into a fully parallelized version using the Java Fork/Join framework.*

## Parallel Computing Project: Dungeon Hunter Parallel

This project simulates a dungeon exploration scenario, inspired by *Solo Leveling*.  
Imagine you are **Sung Jin-Woo**, summoning your shadows to **search concurrently** through a dungeon map, climbing uphill until they find the **strongest mana source** (the dungeon boss).

## Main Files (parallel computing folder)
**DungeonHunterParallel.java** – Main entry point of the program.  
**DungeonMapParallel.java** – Handles dungeon map creation and mana distribution.  
**HuntParallel.java** – Defines the concurrent “shadow hunters” searching for the boss.

## How to Run

**Compile:**
```bash
javac DungeonHunterParallel.java DungeonMapParallel.java HuntParallel.java  
```
**Run:**  
```bash
java DungeonHunterParallel <gate_size> <num_searchers> <seed>
```
gate_size = size of the dungeon map (e.g. 100)

num_searchers = number of concurrent hunters (e.g. 4)

seed = fixed value for reproducible maps, or 0 for randomness

**e.g.**
java DungeonHunterParallel 100 4 0  

## MIPS32 folder  
**A folder containing my MIPS programminh practice questions**  

**question1.asm is for doing fibonacci calculations, but I implemented this using the stack(which is not the most efficient) not registers**  

**question2.asm is for doing calculating/approximating the Euclidean distance between two points using the algorithm:**  
```bash
square_root(n):

     x := n

     i := 0

     loop_while i < n/2:

          x = (x+n/x)/2

          i += 1

     return x
```
